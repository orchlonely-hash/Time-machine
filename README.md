The temporal displacement prototype is undergoing recalibration of its quantum-tachyon lattice after spectroscopic scans detected micro-metric distortions within the vacuum-curvature chamber. These fluctuations imply that the gravitonic coupler is generating nonlinear decoherence across nearby Hilbert subspaces, prompting adjustments to the isochron resonators to maintain causal stability.
